<a name='overview'>Overview</a>
--------
CSBFinder is a standalone Desktop java application with a graphical user interface, 
that can also be executed via command line.

CSBFinder implements a novel methodology for the discovery and ranking of 
colinear syntenic blocks (**CSBs**) - groups of genes that are consistently located close to each other, 
in the same order, across a wide range of taxa.
CSBFinder incorporates an efficient algorithm that identifies CSBs in large genomic datasets. 
The discovered CSBs are ranked according to a probabilistic score and clustered to families according to their gene 
content similarity.

A detailed description of the workflow and the algorithm can be found in the paper: 

Dina Svetlitsky, Tal Dagan, Vered Chalifa-Caspi, Michal Ziv-Ukelson; 
CSBFinder: discovery of colinear syntenic blocks across thousands of prokaryotic genomes, Bioinformatics, 2018,
bty861, [https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty861](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty861)

### Workflow Description
The workflow of CSBFinder is given in the figure below.    

**(A)** The input to the workflow is a dataset of input genomes, where each genome is a sequence of gene orthology group
identifiers (genes belonging to the same orthology group have identical IDs).   

Additional input consists of user-specified parameters **_k_** (number of allowed insertions) and and **_q_** 
(the quorum parameter). In our formulation, a CSB is a pattern that
appears as a substring of at least one of the input genomes, and has instances in at least **_q_** of the input
genomes, where each instance may vary from the CSB pattern by at most **_k_** gene insertions. 

**(B)** The genomes are mined to identify all patterns that qualify as CSBs according to the user-specified parameters. 

**(C)** All discovered CSBs are ranked according to a probabilistic score. 

**(D)** The CSBs are clustered to families according to their gene content similarity, and the rank of a family is
determined by the score of its highest scoring CSB.

<a name='prerequisites'>Prerequisites</a>
--------

[Java Runtime Environment (JRE)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
8 or higher.

<a name='running'>Running CSBFinder</a>
--------
### <a name='download'>Download</a>
- Download the [latest release](https://github.com/dinasv/CSBFinder/releases) of CSBFinder installer.
- The available options are Windows 64 or 32 bit, Unix and MacOS

> CSBFinder has a user interface, but can be executed via the command line by executing the JAR file in the 
installation folder. 

### <a name='ui'>Running CSBFinder via User Interface</a>
Just double click on the CSBFinder executable file in the installation folder, or (if you checked these options 
during installation) from the start menu / Desktop.

> Note: If you are going to use a very large input dataset you might need to change the maximal memory that can be
used by CSBFinder. Go to the installation folder and edit the file "CSBFinder.vmoptions" using a Text Editor. Change
the Java option `-Xmx500m` to `-Xmx[maximal heap size]` depending of the available RAM.
 For example `-Xmx6g` sets the maximal JAVA heap size to 6GB.

 > It is recommended to use at least 6GB for a large dataset. You can specify a higher number, 
 depending on you RAM size.  
 
#### Importing input files

1. **Importing a file with the input genomes**:
    1. Choose `File->Import->Genomes File`. If your dataset is large, this
make take a few minutes.
    > [Sample input files](#sample) are provided in the input directory in the installation folder

    2. The "Run" button should be enabled. Click on this button to set the parameters.
 
    3. A dialog appears. Hover over the question mark icon next to each parameter for an explanation of each parameter. 
After setting the parameters, click on "Run". This can take a few minutes, depending on the size of the dataset and 
on the parameters specified. 

    4. After the process is done, the lower panel will contain all the discovered CSBs. 

2. **Importing a saved session file**:  
    If you have ran CSBFinder and saved a session file, you can load it by choosing `File->Import->Session File`
  
3. **Importing gene orthology group information**:  
Load it by choosing `File->Import->Orthology Information file`. This information will be displayed on the lower right 
 panel.

The following screenshot shows an example of a selected CSB and its instances in the different genomes. The results 
were obtained by running CSBFinder on a dataset of ~1,500 prokaryotic genomes containing only chromosomes. The quorum 
was set to 50 and the number of allowed insertions is 3.

### <a name='cmd'>Running CSBFinder via Command Line </a>

> CSBFinder can be executed via the command line by executing the JAR file in the installation folder. 

- In the terminal (linux) or cmd (windows) type:
    ``` 
    java -jar CSBFinder-[version]-jar-with-dependencies.jar [options]
    ```
    > Note: If your input dataset is very large, add the argument -Xmx6g (6g might be enough, but you can specify a 
    higher number, depending on your RAM size).
    For example:
    ``` 
    java -Xmx6g -jar CSBFinder-[version]-jar-with-dependencies.jar [options]
    ```
    > Note: When running CSBFinder without command line arguments, the user interface will be launched.

### <a name='input_dataset'> Input file containing input genome sequences </a>

A text/fasta file containing all input genomes modeled as strings, where each character is an orthology group ID 
(for example, COG ID) that has been assigned to a corresponding gene 
- This is a mandatory input file
- The path to this file is provided in:
    - User Interface: Load this file by choosing `File->Import->Genomes File`
    - Command Line: "-in" option

This file should use the following format:
```
>[genome name] | [ replicon name (e.g. plasmid or chromosome id)]
[homology group ID] TAB [Strand (+ or -)] TAB [you can add additional information]
[homology group ID] TAB [Strand (+ or -)] TAB [you can add additional information] 
[homology group ID] TAB [Strand (+ or -)] TAB [you can add additional information] 
....
```

All replicons of the same genome should be consecutive, i.e.:
```
>genomeA|replicon1
....
>genomeA|replicon2
...
>genomeB|replicon1
...
```
> Genes that do not belong to any gene orthology group, should be marked as 'X'

#### Assigning genes to orthologous group identifiers

You can annotate genes by any orthologous group identifiers. The IDs can be numbers or symbols, the only restriction 
is that each orthology group will have a unique ID.

##### Examples
1. The [STRING](https://string-db.org/cgi/download.pl?sessionId=Dmc2Jkurdd3b) database contains 
[COG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/) and [NOG](http://eggnogdb.embl.de/) annotations of many publicly 
available genomes
2. Newly sequenced genomes can be mapped to known orthology groups such as:
    - COGs using [CDD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/bwrpsb/bwrpsb.cgi)
    - NOGs using [eggNOG mapper](http://eggnogdb.embl.de/#/app/emapper)
3. A tool such as [Proteinortho](https://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/Software/proteinortho/) detects orthologous genes within different species. 
4. The paper ["New Tools in Orthology Analysis: A Brief Review of Promising Perspectives" by Bruno T. L. Nichio et. al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5674930/)
reviews several current tools for gene orthology detection

### <a name='cog_info'>Input file with functional information of gene orthology group IDs </a>
- This is an optional input file
- The path to this file is provided in:
    - User Interface: `File->Import->Orthology Information file`
    - Command Line: "-cog-info" option
#### COG information input file
If you are using [COGs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/) (Cluster of Orthologous Genes) as your 
gene orthology group identifiers, you can use the file _cog_info.txt_ provided in the input directory in the 
installation folder (also can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/dinasv/CSBFinder/tree/master/input)).

The functional description of gene orthology groups will appear in the legend (User Interface) 
or in the output catalog file (when clicking on the "Save" button in the User Interface, or when 
executing via Command Line).

You can also use a custom file of your own. See instructions below.

### Custom gene orthology group information input file

This file should use the following format:
```
COGID;COG description;[COG functional categries seperated by a comma (e.g. "E,H"); COG functional categry description 1; COG functional categry description 2;...;geneID] 
```
>The text inside the brackets [] is optional
#### Example
```
COG0318;Acyl-CoA synthetase (AMP-forming)/AMP-acid ligase II;I,Q;Lipid transport and metabolism;Secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism;CaiC;
COG0319;ssRNA-specific RNase YbeY, 16S rRNA maturation enzyme;J;Translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis;YbeY;

<a name='output'>Output files</a>
--------------
After clicking on the "Save" button in the User Interface, or after execution via Command Line: two output files will 
be written to the specified directory

- **File 1: A Catalog of CSBs**: An excel file containing the discovered CSBs named "[dataset name]\_ins[number of allowed insertions]\_q[quorum parameter].xlsx"   
    This file contains three sheets: 
    1. Catalog    
        - Each line describes a single CSB
            - ID: unique CSB ID
            - Length: number of characters in the CSB
            - Score: a probabilistic ranking score, higher score indicates higher significance
            - Instance count: number of input sequences with an instance
            - CSB: a sequence of genes
            - Main_Category: if functional category was provided in the -cog-info file, this column contains the functional category of                             the majority of CSB gene families
            - Family_ID: CSBs with similar gene content will belong to the same family, indicated by a postive integer
    2. Filtered CSBs
        - This sheet contains only the top scoring CSB from each family
    3. CSBs description
        - Information about gene family IDs of each CSB

- **File 2: CSB instances**: A FASTA file with the same name as the catalog file, only with the suffix "\_instances"
    
    - Each entry represents a CSB and all its instances in the input genomes 
    - Each entry is composed of a header (CSB ID and genes), followed by lines describing the instances
    - Each line describes the locations of CSB instances in a specific input genome
    - There can be more than one instance in each genome
    - Each instance that is present in a replicon (e.g. chromosome/plasmid), begins from a specific index and can have 
    different lengths, depending on the number of insertions allowed in the instance
    - The index of the first gene in a replicon is 0 
    
    This file has the following format:
    
    ```
    >[CSB ID] TAB [CSB genes]
     [genome name] TAB [replicon name]|[[instance start index (inclusive),instance end index (exclusive)]]
     [genome name] TAB [replicon name]|[[instance start index (inclusive),instance end index (exclusive)]]

     ...
     >[CSB ID] TAB	[CSB genes]
     [genome name] TAB [replicon name]|[[instance start index (inclusive),instance end index (exclusive)]]
     [genome name] TAB [replic     [genome name] TAB [replicon name]|[[instance start index (inclusive),
     instance end index (exclusive)]]
     ...

    ```
<a name='sample'>Sample input files</a>   
--------------------------------------
Sample input files are located in the input directory of the installation folder.
You can also download the following zip file:
> [Sample_input_files.zip](https://github.com/dinasv/CSBFinder/raw/master/input/Sample_input_files.zip)

The above zip file contains three files, located inside a folder named 'input':
- plasmid_genomes.fasta   
    _Plasmid dataset_ - 471 prokaryotic genomes with at least one plasmid, chromosomes were removed.
- chromosomal_genomes.fasta    
    _Chromosomal dataset_ - 1,485 prokaryotic genomes with at least one chromosome, plasmids were removed.
    > Important: this is a huge dataset. See instructions below, how to run CSBFinder with a large dataset
- cog_info.txt   
    Functional information of gene orthology groups

### Execution of CSBFinder on the Chromosomal Dataset of 1,485 prokaryotic genomes
  
#### User Interface

The file _chromosomal_genomes.fasta_ contains ~1,500 genomes, hence CSBFinder needs more heap memory.
When uploading a large dataset.

Go to the installation folder and edit the file "CSBFinder.vmoptions" using a Text Editor. Change
the Java option `-Xmx500m` to `-Xmx[maximal heap size]` depending of the available RAM. Changing to at least `-Xmx6g` 
is recommended (sets the maximal JAVA heap size to 6GB).

Now execute CSBfinder and choose `File->Import->Genomes File`, it may take a few minutes to load the selected file.

##### Input Parameters
Click on the "Run" button, and a dialog will open.

The screenshot below shows a typical parameter setting.
- The quorum parameter is set to 50 (i.e., each CSB must have instances in at least 50 input genomes).  
- The number of allowed insertions in a CSB instance is one.
