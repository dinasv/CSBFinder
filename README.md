CSBFinder-S is a standalone Desktop java application with a graphical user interface, 
that can also be executed via command line.

CSBFinder-S implements a novel methodology for the discovery and ranking of 
colinear syntenic blocks (**CSBs**) - groups of genes that are consistently located close to each other, 
in the same order, across a wide range of taxa.
CSBFinder-S incorporates efficient algorithms that identify CSBs in large genomic datasets. 
The discovered CSBs are ranked according to a probabilistic score and clustered to families according to their gene 
content similarity.

The overall toolkit includes two components, implementing two distinct algorithms and released in separate versions. 
The first, denoted CSBFinder (published in ([Svetlitsky et. al., 2018](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty861/5132694?guestAccessKey=1f04c37d-2e8f-4031-b802-08e73feff24b)), cited below), incorporated a suffix-tree based 
algorithm, and was optimized to seek single-operon CSBs. 
The second version, CSBFinder-S ([Svetlitsky et. al., 2020](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/36/Supplement_1/i21/5870523), cited below), 
generalizes the tool to cross-strand, multi operon CSBs and 
incorporates a match-point arithmetic based algorithm to efficiently support the generalizations. 

### March 27, 2019 update

**CSBFinder-S** for the discovery of cross-strand multi-operon CSBs is released

- In this version, the user can decide whether to segment the input genomes into directons (consecutive genes on the same 
strand) 

- A novel exact algorithm that uses match-point arithmetic is proposed and implemented. 
The time and space complexities of the algorithm are insensitive to the number of insertions and maximal CSB length. 
The new algorithm is faster than the algorithm given in (Svetlitsky et. al., 2018) for larger values of 
insertions allowed. Additional advantages of the new algorithm are its simplicity of implementation, and the fact that it is easily 
parallelizable, yielding further scalability.

CSBFinder-S provides several novel mechanisms to help the user sort, filter, and interpret the discovered CSBs. 
- A ranking score that considers the genomic distances between the genomes in which the corresponding CSBs 
appear. 
- The user can constrain the structural features of the desired CSBs (length, abundance, etc.), as well as to extract 
CSBs confined to specific functional semantic categories. 

- A taxonomic viewer of the genomes that contain instances of each CSB.

- Many other improvements have been incorporated in the user interface

### Workflow Description
The workflow of CSBFinder-S is given in the figure below.    

**(A)** The input to the workflow is a dataset of input genomes, where each genome is modeled as a sequence of gene 
identifiers: A gene identifier indicates the corresponding gene orthology group as well as the strand (+/-) in which 
the gene is encoded. 
Additional input consists of user-specified parameters **_k_** (number of allowed insertions) and **_q_** 
(the quorum parameter). In our formulation, a CSB is a pattern that
appears as a substring of at least one of the input genomes, and has instances in at least **_q_** of the input
genomes, where each instance may vary from the CSB pattern by at most **_k_** gene insertions. 

**(B)** The genomes are mined to identify all patterns that qualify as CSBs according to the user-specified parameters. 

**(C)** All discovered CSBs are ranked according to a probabilistic score. 

**(D)** The CSBs are clustered to families according to their gene content similarity, and the rank of a family is
determined by the score of its highest scoring CSB.

### Citation
The following paper contains details regarding the first version of CSBFinder-S, denoted CSBFinder, that targeted the extraction of 
CSBs that correspond to operons. It contains details of the Suffix-Tree based algorithm for CSB extraction. 
The options to use the Suffix-Tree based algorithm, and the extraction of directon CSBs, are still available in the 
new CSBFinder-S tool.

### <a name='input_dataset'> Input file containing input genome sequences </a>

A text/fasta file containing all input genomes modeled as strings, where each character is an orthology group ID 
(for example, COG ID) that has been assigned to a corresponding gene 
- This is a mandatory input file
- The path to this file is provided in:
    - User Interface: Load this file by choosing `File->Import->Genomes File`
    - Command Line: "-in" option

This file should use the following format:
```
>[genome name] | [ replicon name (e.g. plasmid or chromosome id)]
[homology group ID] TAB [Strand (+ or -)] TAB [you can add additional information]
[homology group ID] TAB [Strand (+ or -)] TAB [you can add additional information] 
[homology group ID] TAB [Strand (+ or -)] TAB [you can add additional information] 
....
```

All replicons of the same genome should be consecutive, i.e.:
```
>genomeA|replicon1
....
>genomeA|replicon2
...
>genomeB|replicon1
...
```
> Genes that do not belong to any gene orthology group, should be marked as 'X'

#### Example:

#### Assigning genes to orthology group identifiers

You can annotate genes by any orthology group identifiers. The IDs can be numbers or symbols, the only restriction 
is that each orthology group will have a unique ID.

##### Examples
1. The [STRING](https://string-db.org/cgi/download.pl?sessionId=Dmc2Jkurdd3b) database contains 
[COG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/) and [NOG](http://eggnogdb.embl.de/) annotations of many publicly 
available genomes
2. Newly sequenced genomes can be mapped to known orthology groups such as:
    - COGs using [CDD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/bwrpsb/bwrpsb.cgi)
    - NOGs using [eggNOG mapper](http://eggnogdb.embl.de/#/app/emapper)
3. A tool such as [Proteinortho](https://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/Software/proteinortho/) detects orthologous genes within different species. 
4. The paper ["New Tools in Orthology Analysis: A Brief Review of Promising Perspectives" by Bruno T. L. Nichio et. al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5674930/)
reviews several current tools for gene orthology detection

<a name='sample'>Example of running CSBFinder-S</a>   
--------------------------------------
Sample input files are located in the input directory of the installation folder.
You can also download by clicking on this link:
> [Sample_input_files.zip](https://github.com/dinasv/CSBFinder/blob/master/input/input.zip?raw=true)

The above zip file contains four files, located inside a folder named 'input':
- plasmid_genomes.fasta   
    _Plasmid dataset_ - 471 prokaryotic genomes with at least one plasmid, chromosomes were removed.
- chromosomal_genomes.fasta    
    _Chromosomal dataset_ - 1,485 prokaryotic genomes with at least one chromosome, plasmids were removed.
    > Important: this is a huge dataset. See instructions below, how to run CSBFinder-S with a large dataset
- cog_info.txt   
    Functional information of gene orthology groups
- taxa_csbfinder.txt   
    Taxonomy information for the user interface

### Execution of CSBFinder-S on the Plasmid Dataset of 471 microbial genomes

#### User Interface 

- Execute CSBfinder-S and choose `File->Import->Genomes File`

- You can also import `cog_info.txt` and `taxa_csbfinder.txt` for additional displayed information

- Click on the "Run" button, and a window will open.

- Set the parameters (e.g. Quorum 10, Insertions Allowed 1). If you are interested in cross-strand CSBs, check the 
corresponding check-box. The algorithm for CSB extraction can also be selected.

- Clicking on the "Run" button will start the computation of CSBs, this may take a few minutes.
 When the process is done, the results will be shown.

##### Output
You can export the resulting CSBs as a TXT or XLSX file.
You can also save the results in a session file, that can be opened using the user interface.

#### Command Line
``` 
java -jar CSBFinder-[version]-jar-with-dependencies.jar -in input/plasmid_genomes.fasta -q 10 -ins 1 -e plasmids 
-cog-info input/cog_info.txt
```
##### Input parameters 
- The input genomes files is _plasmid_genomes.fasta_ located in the input directory.  
- The quorum parameter is set to 10 (i.e., each CSB must have instances in at least 10 input genomes).  
- The number of allowed insertions in a CSB instance is one.  
- The export file name is _"plasmids"_
- The gene orthology input file is _cog_info.txt_ located in the input directory

##### Output
The output files will be now located in the output directory
> On a laptop computer with Intel model i7 processor and 8GB RAM, this execution should take a few seconds

### Execution of CSBFinder-S on the Chromosomal Dataset of 1,485 prokaryotic genomes
  
#### User Interface

The file _chromosomal_genomes.fasta_ contains ~1,500 genomes, hence CSBFinder-S needs more heap memory.
When uploading a large dataset.

Go to the installation folder and edit the file "CSBFinder-S.vmoptions" using a Text Editor. Change
the Java option `-Xmx500m` to `-Xmx[maximal heap size]` depending of the available RAM. Changing to at least `-Xmx6g` 
is recommended (sets the maximal JAVA heap size to 6GB).

- Now execute CSBfinder-S and choose `File->Import->Genomes File`, it may take a few minutes to load the selected file.

- You can also import `cog_info.txt` and `taxa_csbfinder.txt` for additional displayed information

- Click on the "Run" button, and a window will open.

- Set the parameters (e.g. Quorum 50, Insertions Allowed 1). If you are interested in cross-strand CSBs, check the 
  corresponding check-box. The algorithm for CSB extraction can also be selected.

- Clicking on the "Run" button will start the computation of CSBs, this may take a few minutes.
 When the process is done, the results will be shown.

##### Output
You can export the resulting CSBs as a TXT or XLSX file.
You can also save the results in a session file, that can be opened using the user interface.

#### Command Line
In the installation directory, you will find a *.jar file, e.g., CSBFinder-S-0.6.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar
``` 
java -Xmx6g -jar CSBFinder-S-[version]-jar-with-dependencies.jar -in input/chromosomal_genomes.fasta -q 50 -ins 1 -e Chromosomes 
-cog-info input/cog_info.txt
```
##### Input parameters
- This line will execute the jar file with maximal heap size (memory) of 6GB.   
- The input genomes files is _chromosomal_genomes.fasta_ located in the input directory.  
- The quorum parameter is set to 50 (i.e., each CSB must have instances in at least 50 input genomes).  
- The number of allowed insertions in a CSB instance is one.  
- The export file name is _"Chromosomes"_
- The gene orthology input file is _cog_info.txt_ located in the input directory

##### Output
The output files will be now located in the output directory

> On a laptop computer with Intel model i7 processor and 8GB RAM, this execution should take less than 5 minutes

--------------------------------------
- Save - saving a session file (*.csb extension). This will save the current session, all filtered-out CSBs will be lost.
- Double-clicking on a CSB gene, aligns all other CSBs/instances according to this gene
- Re-clustering to families after filtration
- Re-computing CSB scores with different paramaters

##### Properties files
The following files are present in the installation directory
1. config.properties:   
Include paths to Session file, Taxonomy file, and Orthology info file. 
These files will be loaded automatically when launching the program

2. CSBFinder-S.vmoptions:   
Increase the memory (RAM) used by the program, by changing MEM in -Xmx[MEM] (e.g., -Xmx6g)
